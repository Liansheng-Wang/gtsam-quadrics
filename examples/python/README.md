## Basic Examples: ## 

* **simple_example.py**: In this short python script we add a number of poses / quadrics to the initial estimate and add odometry / boundingbox measurements to the factor graph. We generate boundingbox measurements by reprojecting the quadric into the image at each pose and calculating the conics bounds.
